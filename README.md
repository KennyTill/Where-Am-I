# Where Am I?
Addon for WoW that tells you what server you are on. This addon is still under development and may have bugs or issues. It is undergoing a live test. 

###Use at your own risk!



#Installation

Download the main `WhereAmI` folder and place it in your addons directory. This can be found in `World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\`.

The addon should be enabled by default. If it isn't, enable it in game by clicking the `AddOns` button on the character select screen and making sure the checkbox next to it is checked.

From in the game, it will tell you what Server you are currently on in your chat window. If you want to check manually, you may type `/where` or `/whereami` in game.
